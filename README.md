#LLM-Powered Natural Language to SQL Chatbot

This project is a full-stack chatbot application that converts natural language queries into SQL commands using a Groq-hosted LLM (Llama 3.1 / Mistral-7B). It fetches and displays data from a relational database based on user input. The backend is powered by FastAPI, and the frontend is built with ReactJS.
